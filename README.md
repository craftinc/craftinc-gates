#AncientGates - Easily create portals with custom design#

Read the full userguide here: TODO

With this plugin the server operators (OPs) can create gates that will teleport anyone who enter to a location specific to that gate. The hightlights are: __It is so darn easy to use!__ :D and __The gates can look any way you like__ \o/

Try the ingame command: __/gate__
Thought first you should take a look at the demonstration bladedpenguin  and karibu6 created:

##FAQ##

__Why the name AncientGates?__

Because the purpose of this plugin that I envision is that players should not be able to create gates to other worlds themselves. The server operators build gates with cool ruins around them and in order to get to another world the players need to find one of those ruins.

__Who can create a gate?__

Only server operators! Not normal players. There is no suport for any permissions plugin.

__Who can destroy a gate?__

Anyone if you do not use a third-party protection plugin like Factions.

__Are there IConnomy integration, Features for user to dial other gates etc?__

Nope. This plugin is very minimalistic and plain. Server operators manage the portals players use them any time they are open.
