<Logo here>

We are happy to finally announce __Craft Inc. Gates__. 

This awesome plugin lets you _travel_ to far away places and worlds _faster then light_! Just create a gate at any locations and set an exit somewhere else.

This has been made available by the hard work of the research and development department of the _Craft Inc. Cooperation_. Under the lead of Professor Didderr Craftman scientists worked years to find a way to bend time and space inside the minecraft universe to enable _ultra fast transportation_.

Now it is time for _you_ to try out this wonderful plugin. Simply install this plugin, create a gate and feel the funny tickle in your brain while traveling.*

The key features of this are:

* Gates with and without a frame
* Gates consisting of portal blocks or gates made of air (so called hidden gates)
* Gates with destinations in different worlds
* Gates with custom shapes (gates can any way you want)


*The Craft Inc. Cooperation won't take any responsibility for sea sickness, memory loss and sudden suffocation in walls while traveling with our gates!
## FAQ ##

__Who can create a gate?__

Have a look at the [_Permissions_](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/craftinc-gates/pages/permissions/) page.

__Who can destroy a gate?__

Anyone if you do not use a third-party protection plugin like Grief Prevention.

__Is there a IConnomy integration? Features for user to dial other gates etc?__

Nope. We currently don't plane to integrate such features. I you really need such a feature please inform us. If there are a lot of people requesting such features we might change our mind.

__Is there a list of all commands?__

Sure, type _/gate help_ in-game or have a look at the [_Commands_](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/craftinc-gates/pages/commands/) page.

__When I destroy the frame of gate it stops working. Shouldn't it still work?__

Yes and no. To make gates without a frame work you need to tweak the _checkForBrokenGateFrames_ setting. Have a look at the [_Configuration_](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/craftinc-gates/pages/configuration/) page for more information.


## Usage ##
With this plugin you can create gates which will teleport players anywhere you want. The gates can look any way you like.

To make the gate work place yourself inside a newly created gate frame and type __/gate new [id]__. Afterwards walk to the destination of your portal and type __/gate exit [id]__ to set the destination. With __/gate open [id]__ you can get your newly created gate to work.

To hide a gate simply call __/gate hide [id]__. Now that gate wonâ€™t have purple blocks when opened.

Have a look at the [_Commands_](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/craftinc-gates/pages/commands/) page to find out how to modify gates even further.
